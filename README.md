# Non-topological logarithmic corrections in minimal gauged supergravity

This algorithm computes the heat kernel expansion (the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients a_0, a_2, a_4) for an arbitrary background and two-derivative Lagrangian (bosonic and fermionic). The main file is AlgoLog.nb which has two dependencies: Functions.nb where the functions are implemented and a background-specific file (here EMsolution.nb). This code is public domain and free to use.
